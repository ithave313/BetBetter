# BetBetter

## Final project for Database Concepts course
Created a website where a user could utilize a neural network with 78% accuracy to predict the winner of any given NFL game. Spreads and team info were webscraped from Draftkings.com and stored in a database which interacted with the website. Users could also store their previous bets and whether they were successful or not.
